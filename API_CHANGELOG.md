# Hospitable API Changelog

This document tracks changes to the Hospitable Public API that may affect the SDK.

## August 1st, 2025

### Track messages sent via the API

Previously, when sending a message via the Messaging API, no response data was returned. This was due to the synchronous nature of some booking platforms, which prevented us from immediately confirming the message details.

As a result, it wasn't possible to match a sent message with the corresponding message.created webhook.

**New feature**: `sent_reference_id`
- Returned in the API response when a message is sent
- Included in the `message.created` webhook payload
- Enables reliable correlation between sent messages and webhook events
- Makes end-to-end message tracking possible

**SDK Impact**: ‚úÖ Already supported via `MessageSendResponse.sent_reference_id`

## July 30th, 2025

New property to help identify owner stays:
- Included in reservation-specific webhooks and API responses
